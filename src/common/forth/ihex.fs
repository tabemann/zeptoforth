\ This Forth Program : Dumps a iHex image of the target MCU dictionary to the
\ terminal where it can be captured in a terminal log and turned into a 
\ bootable binary file clone of the target.
\ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\     Usage:    "clone"
\ 
\ The iHex dump starts with the word "clone" and ends with the word "clone_end"
\ for easy parsing to remove any extraneous text before using
\ 'arm-none-eabi-objcopy'.
\ 
\ Once you have the iHex File process it as below.
\
\ " arm-none-eabi-objcopy -I ihex -O binary <your-iHex-logfile> <binaryfile-name.bin> "
\ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Notes:
\ Can produce extended iHex files up to 32 bits, i.e. 4 GB.
\ iHex Extended Addressing type 04 is used
\ -------------------- Shouldn't need to change anything below ----------------
