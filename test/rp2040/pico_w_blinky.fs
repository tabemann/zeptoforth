\ Note that prior to running this code, one must upload the CYW43439 firmware
\ and CYW43439 driver to one's Raspberry Pi Pico W (this does not work on a
\ Raspberry Pi Pico) as follows:
\ 
\ Execute from the base directory of zeptoforth:
\ 
\ utils/load_cyw43_fw.sh <tty device> <43439A0.bin path> <43439A0_clm.bin path>
\ 
\ 43439A0.bin and 43439A0_clm.bin can be gotten from:
\ https://github.com/tabemann/cyw43-firmware/tree/master/cyw43439-firmware
\ 
\ Then execute from the base directory of zeptoforth:
\ 
\ utils/codeload3.sh -B 115200 -p <tty device> serial extra/rp_common/pico_w_net_ipv4_all.fs
\ 
\ If one only desires the CYW43439 driver and not zeptoIP, the following can be
\ substituted:
\ 
\ utils/codeload3.sh -B 115200 -p <tty device> serial extra/rp2040/cyw43/cyw43_all.fs
\ 
\ Once this setup is complete, load this code and then execute:
\ 
\ pico-w-blinky::run-blinky

begin-module pico-w-blinky
