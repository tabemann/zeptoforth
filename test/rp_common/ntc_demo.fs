\ This is a demo of using ntc module with various thermistors.
\
\ Circuit diagram:
\
\  Pi Pico 3V3 -------+
\   (3V3 - Pin36)     |
\                     R0 - Resistor, R0 = RT at 25ºC
\                     |
\  Pi Pico ADC0 ------+
\   (GP26 - Pin31)    |
\                     RT - Thermistor
\                     |
\  Pi Pico GND -------+
\   (GND - Pin28)
\
\ With continuous use, the thermistor can self-heat, 
\ leading to an inaccurate reading at the AD input.
