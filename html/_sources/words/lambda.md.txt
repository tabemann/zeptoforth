# Lambda Words

In zeptoforth the user can define lightweight anonymous functions, known as lambdas, inline in other words with `[:` and `;]`, where `[:` starts compiling a lambda, and `;]` finishes it. compiling the `xt` for the lambda as a literal into the containing word. Multiple lambdas can be nested. Note that lambdas have no headers, making them lighter-weight than normal words. Provided that all words compiled into them are themselves inlined, they can be inlined into other words.

`[:` and `;]` are defined in `src/common/forth/basic.fs`, but the other words discussed here are defined in `src/common/forth/lambda.fs`.

### `forth`

These words are in `forth`.

There are two simple conditional combinators, namely:

##### `qif`
( ??? f true-xt -- ??? )

which takes *f* and *true-xt*, which is executed when *f* is non-zero; *true-xt* has the following signature:

( ??? -- ??? )

##### `qifelse`
( ??? f true-xt false-xt -- ??? )

which takes *f*, *true-xt*, and *false-xt*; *true-xt* is executed when *f* is non-zero and *false-xt* is executed when *f* is zero. These have the following signature:

( ??? -- ??? )

There are two simple looping combinators:

##### `quntil`
( ??? xt -- ??? )

which takes *xt* and executes it repeatedly until it returns a non-zero value; *xt* has the following signature:

( ??? -- ??? f )

##### `qwhile`
( ??? while-xt body-xt -- ??? )

which in a loop first executes *while-xt* and, if it returns a non-zero value, then it executes *body-xt* and continues looping, else it exits the loop; *while-xt* has the signature:

( ??? -- ??? f )

and *body-xt* has the signature:

( ??? -- ??? )

There are two counted looping combinators:

##### `qcount`
( ??? limit init xt -- ??? )

which counts up with an increment of one from *init* until it reaches *limit*, not including it, executing *xt* at each step, passing it the current count; *xt* has the signature:

( ??? i -- ??? )

##### `qcount+`
( ??? limit init xt -- ??? )

which counts up or down with a variable increment from *init* until it reaches *limit*, not including it for counting up but including it for counting down, executing *xt* at each step, passing it the current count and receiving the increment/decrement for the next step; *xt* has the signature:

( ??? i -- ??? increment )
