<h1>Action Words</h1>
<p>Actions provide a means of asynchronous processing involving message-passing that is lighter-weight than tasks as all computation takes place within a single task and there is none of the complexities of dealing with multiprocessing (except when handling other tasks adding actions to or removing actions from a scheduler that is currently running within a given task, which are minimal in impact). Individual actions do not have their own stacks but rather share the stacks of their parent task.</p>
<p>Message-passing between actions is synchronous; a given action is halted when it is waiting to receive a message or when it is waiting for the message it has sent to be received. Messages can be of any size, and are stored in a buffer provided by the sending task and copied into a buffer provided by the receiving task when received. Note that no order is guaranteed with regard to message-passing, but messages are guaranteed to be eventually received. Note that actions may only send messages to actions within the same schedule; otherwise they will be ignored. Also, if an action is waiting to send a message and that other message is removed from the schedule, the first action is unblocked.</p>
<p>Schedules may be run in any task, may have actions added to or removed from them at any time, and may be stopped safely at any time (the current action’s execution is completed before the schedule stops executing). One note is that a schedule may not be run while it is already running, whether from within the same task or from within a different task.</p>

<p>Send a message in a buffer at <em>addr</em> of size <em>bytes</em> to action <em>dest-action</em> and set the send execution token to be called once the message is sent or message-sending fails to <em>send-xt</em>. <em>send-xt</em> has the signature ( – ). Sending a message is synchronous; the current action will not execute until either the message is received or the message becomes unable to be sent. <em>dest-action</em> must be in the current schedule or otherwise this routine is a no-op. Sending a message must be done within an executing schedule; messages may not be sent outside of a schedule. Only one message may be sent before control returns to the scheduler; to send multiple messages, send them within subsequent <em>send-xt</em>s.</p>
