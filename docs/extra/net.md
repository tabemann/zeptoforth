# zeptoIP Words

zeptoIP is an Internet Protocol stack for zeptoforth. Currently it supports the Raspberry Pi Pico W and Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W's CYW43439 WiFi chip. Unofficially it should also work on the Pimoroni Pico Plus 2 W as well. By design it can be extended to any WiFi or Ethernet interface which exposes receiving and sending Ethernet frames. It expressly does not support WiFi interfaces such as the ESP8285 on the Wio RP2040 which operate by using their own protocols such as the "AT" protocol. Note that there are separate bodies of code for zeptoIP for IPv4 and IPv6, which are referred to in particular as zeptoIPv4 and zeptoIPv6.

zeptoIP is centered around one or more _interfaces_, instances of `net::<interface>`each of which has its own IPv4 or IPv6 address (and in the case of IPv6 there is also a link-local IPv6 address), netmask in the case of IPv4, prefix and prefix length in the case of IPv6, gateway IPv4 or IPv6 address, and DNS server IPv4 or IPv6 address. With interfaces sources of incoming (and in the case of TCP data, outgoing) data, known as _endpoints_, instances of `net::<endpoint>` may be created, endpoints with ready data or state changes can be fetched, UDP packets may be sent, IP addresses of hostnames can be resolved via DNS, and IPv4 and IPv6 addresses may be acquired via DHCP or, in the case of IPv6, SLAAC.

Endpoints encapsulate connection state in the case of TCP, and received packet state in the case of UDP. Reading received data from an endpoint need not require copying the data; the received data associated with an endpoint is valid until the endpoint is marked as _done_, at which the received data is cleared from the endpoint's buffer and the room it took up in the endpoint's buffer is made available for more received data. Note that data continues to be received even between the time that ready endpoint is fetched with `net::get-ready-endpoint` or is waited for with `net::wait-ready-endpoint` and it is marked as done with `net::endpoint-done`. Also note that with UDP endpoints the ready data at any one data comprises only a single received UDP packet's data.

The typical means by which endpoints are serviced is by creating an _endpoint processor_, an instance of `endpoint-process::<endpoint-process>`, and registering an _endpoint handler_, an instance of `endpoint-process::<endpoint-handler>` with it. The endpoint processor involves a task which fetches ready endpoints one at a time from an interface, and then applies it to each registered endpoint handler. Once all the endpoint handlers have processed the endpoint, it should be marked as done to make it available for new data or state changes.

A more conventional approach to servicing endpoints, albeit one that requires multiple tasks if multiple endpoints are to be serviced, is through calling `net::wait-ready-endpoint`, which blocks until the endpoint is ready, and then promotes the data its receive buffer.

Sending data is done differently with regard to TCP and UDP. With TCP sending data requires a TCP endpoint, gotten through either receiving an incoming connection on a listening TCP endpoint, started with `net::allocate-tcp-listen-endpoint`, which will result in the endpoint being readied with the appropriate state change(s), or starting a TCP connection with `net-ipv4::allocate-tcp-connect-ipv4-endpoint` (for IPv4) or `net-ipv6::allocate-tcp-connect-ipv6-endpoint` (for IPv6), at which an TCP endpoint will be provided to the user. Once one has done this, all that one must do is call `send-tcp-endpoint`, which will send the provided data unless the connection is closed or reset, where then it will exit prematurely. With UDP sending data simply requires executing `net-ipv4::send-ipv4-udp-packet` (for IPv4) or `net-ipv6::send-ipv6-udp-packet` (for IPv6).

Closing an endpoint is accomplished through `net::close-tcp-endpoint`, for TCP endpoints, and `net::close-udp-endpoint`, for UDP endpoints. Closing UDP endpoints is immediate, while closing TCP endpoints involves waiting for the endpoint to be closed after a four-way handshake.

If the user wishes to listen to multiple connections on the same point they must allocate multiple endpoints to listen on; incoming connections will be alloted to each of these endpoints.

Note that there is a fixed number of available endpoints which is set at compile-time, specified by the constant `net-config::max-endpoints`. This is set to four by default.
