# Allocator Words

The allocator in zeptoforth enables the user to create any number of heaps (but in the general use case allows creating a shared heap used implicitly by `allocate`, `resize`, `free`, `allocate!`, `resize!`, and `free!`). Heaps are allocated in the dictionary space, and the shared heap must be manually allocated with `init-shared-heap` before it may be used.

The following words are in `forth-module`:

##### `allocate`
( bytes -- addr -1|0 )

Allocate memory on the current heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure

##### `free`
( addr -- -1|0 )

Free memory on the current heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure

##### `resize`
( addr new-bytes -- addr -1|0 )

Resize memory on the current heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure

##### `allocate!`
( bytes -- addr )

Allocate memory in the heap, raising an exception if allocation fails.

##### `resize!`
( addr new-bytes -- new-addr )

Resize memory in the heap, raising an exception if allocation fails.

##### `free!`
( addr -- )

Free memory in the heap, raising an exception if freeing fails.

##### `x-memory-management-failure`
( -- )

Memory management failure exception

The following words are in `allocate-wordlist`:

##### `init-heap-header`
( high-block-size -- heap )

Create an heap with a specified heap size and a specified largest size in the array of sized free lists

##### `expand-heap`
( block-size heap -- )

Expand the heap

##### `init-shared-heap`
( heap-size high-block-size -- )

Initialize the shared heap

##### `x-no-shared-heap`
( -- )

No shared heap exists

##### `allocate-with-heap`
( bytes heap -- addr -1|0 )

Allocate memory on a heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure

##### `free-with-heap`
( addr heap -- -1|0 )

Free memory on a heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure

##### `resize-with-heap`
( addr new-bytes heap -- addr -1|0 )

Resize memory on a heap; returns -1 on success and 0 on failure
